# DSCI 100 (Group 7)
Authors: Lucas Kuhn, Sophia Zhang, Michael Cheung

## Introduction

This is the Github repository for our team project in DSCI 100.
As a high-level outline, our goal is to create a predictive question with the purpose of classifying a new observation using K-nearest neighbours trained on a set of known observations and their respective classifications.

## Topic

For this project, we have brainstormed the following possibilities:

- Exoplanet Archive Analysis
    - Using previous archive data regarding classifications of known exoplanets, devise a range of values across various relevant variables that would constitute an exoplanet that has certain characteristics (e.g. is habitable to humans, may support life, may contain liquid water); use these ranges to predict whether a new exoplanet can be classified as such
    - Possible datasets reachable at [this link](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/data.html)

- Pulsar Star Classification
    - Using the HTRU2 dataset containing examples of both pulsar and non-pulsar type stars, create a visualization to determine possible clustering of data points into those target classes, as well as train a K-nearest neighbours model to determine ranges of values where pulsar and non-pulsar stars would fall
    - HTRU2 dataset reachable and downloadable from [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2)
