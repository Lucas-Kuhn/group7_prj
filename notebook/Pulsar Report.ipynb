    "## Introduction\n",
    "\"Pulsar\" neutron stars produce radio emissions that are of great interest to astronomers and researchers. In this project, we set out to develop a model for classifying them distinctly from those that are \"non-pulsar\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Our question to answer: \"Are there characteristics of a pulsar candidate's curve profiles that serve as good predictors for pulsar and non-pulsar classification?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the HTRU2 dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains summary statistics for observed pulsar candidates as they exhibit on both the Integrated Pulse (folded) Profile, as well as on the Dispersion Measure Signal-to-Noise Ratio (DM-SNR) curve.\n",

    "We plan to train multiple models using various subsets of the summary-statistic columns as predictor variables, given how the pulses for a candidate that is truly pulsar are \"remarkably constant over long periods of time\" (Karastergiou et. al, 2011) and as such tend to reveal prominent insights on curve profiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use scatter plots similar to above to qualitatively assess pairs of variables for any distinct separation or clustering of classified points. Plots like this provide an interface for human inspection, as used to train other models such as artificial neural networks (Eatough et al., 2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will fit a K-Nearest Neighbours classifier model to our training data, using a GridSearchCV with 5-fold Cross-Validation to choose $k$. This allows us to efficiently test the validation accuracy at many values of $k$ and combat both overfitting and underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our best model, we can assess its accuracy on the testing set using a confusion matrix, allowing us to more critically assess the accuracy based on whether false positives are more costly than false negatives."
